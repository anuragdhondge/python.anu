#You are going to write a program that will mark a spot on a map with an X.
#Your job is to write a program that allows you to mark a square on the map using a letter-number system.
#First, your program must take the user input and convert it to a usable format.
#Next, you need to use that input to update your nested list with an "X". 
#Example Input 1
#B3
#Example Output 1
#Hiding your treasure! X marks the spot.
#['⬜️', '️⬜️', '️⬜️']
#['⬜️', '⬜️', '️⬜️']
#['⬜️️', 'X', '⬜️️']

line1 = ["⬜️","️⬜️","️⬜️"]
line2 = ["⬜️","⬜️","️⬜️"]
line3 = ["⬜️️","⬜️️","⬜️️"]
map = [line1, line2, line3]
print("Hiding your treasure! X marks the spot.")
position = input() # Where do you want to put the treasure?
letter = position[0].lower()
abc = ["a", "b", "c"]
letter_index = abc.index(letter)
number_index = int(position[1]) - 1
map[number_index][letter_index] = "X"
print(f"{line1}\n{line2}\n{line3}")
